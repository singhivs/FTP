For this project, I first implemented s program to parse the required command line syntax and the incoming data. I used urlib.parse to parse the URL. Then I opened a connection to the control socket. After that I sucessfully added support to login into the FTP server by the sending the correct USER and PASS. Once, I recieved the correct response for this, I implemented the fuunctionalty. I have a if statements in my main function that check which command has been given on the command line and call the helper functions accrodingly. I also have a function to open the data channel whenever it is required. Then, I implemented the ls, cp, mv functionality. I close the data channel when the server is done sending the data. 
Some challeneges I faced were related to parsing the command line arguments. The path supplied in the command line argument was not extracted corretly by my program, which cause my program to error. 
I tested the code by looking at the responses sent by the FTP server. I looked for the three digit Code that the FTP server sends and if was 2XX, it meant that the program has been sucessful. I ran multiple tests to make surethe program runs correctly.
